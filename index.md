The following article sections will briefly touch on LSTM neuron cells, give a toy example of predicting a sine wave then walk through the application to a stochastic time series. The article assumes a basic working knowledge of simple deep neural networks.

### Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is a set of processes and analyses that allow businesses to identify and prevent unauthorised financial activity. This may include fraudulent credit card transactions, identity theft, cyber hacking, insurance scams and more.
